# NeuralNetworkRunner
Neural network runner is my first Ai-deep-learnign project made from scratch
Its made in Unity 3D but it can be run without Unity using exported version that can be found inside [Builds]((./Builds/)
After you run game for first time settings file will be created inside folder [Exports]((./Exports/)
There you can change settings look at scores or share neural network with others.

## For more advanced users 
you can change code to test what does each parameter does but you will need Unity Editor for that 
Then under object GameController you can Change Ai learning parameters, number of layers, etc.
